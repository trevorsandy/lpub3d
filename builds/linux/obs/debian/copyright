 DON'T BE A DICK PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING,
 DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
 Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be a dick.
 .
 Being a dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:
 .
 1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy this and change the name.
 1b. Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever,
 that's REALLY being a dick.
 1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content.
 That would make you a PROPER dick.
 .
 If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or
 supporting the original work, share the love. Only a dick would make loads off
 this work and not buy the original work's creator(s) a pint.
 .
 Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching
 when it goes wrong makes you a DONKEY dick. Fix the problem yourself.
 A non-dick would submit the fix back.
