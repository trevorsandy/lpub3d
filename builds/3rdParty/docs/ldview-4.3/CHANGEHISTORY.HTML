<b class="Bigger">4.1</b><br/>
(03 Dec, 2009)
</td>
<td colspan="2">
<b>Additions</b>
<ul>
<li>Added curve smoothing option for POV-Ray exports.</li>
<li>Added ability to highlight the geometry represented by currently selected
line(s) in the model tree. (Note that multiple selection in the model tree is
only supported on the Mac.)</li>
<li>Added status bar to model tree showing the filename and line number of the
currently selected line.</li>
<li>Added ability to randomize colors (useful for part authoring).</li>
<li>Added view mode toggle to default toolbar (Windows and Mac only).</li>
<li>Added toolbar customization, along with the ability to put a lot of LDView
functionality on the toolbar (Windows and Mac only).</li>
<li>Added OK and Cancel buttons to the MPD dialog.  Hitting OK causes the
selected sub-model to remain selection after the dialog is dismissed.</li>
<li>Added remote control support to Windows version, so other programs can
make LDView perform certain functions.</li>
<li>Added "Overwrite existing snapshot" option to Parts List dialog when
"Show model" is checked.</li>
<li>Added 3D-Studio export.</li>
<li>Added ability to specify step from the command line.</li>
<li>Added ability to specify MPD sub-model name from the command line.</li>
<li>Added "Automatic" aspect ratio setting for POV exports.</li>
<li>Added new !LDVIEW BBOX_IGNORE meta command, to allow you to specify parts of
the model that LDView should ignore during bounding box calculations.  That way,
the default zoom and zoom to fit can be tighter.</li>
<li>Add support for "ri" and "r" ring primitives.</li>
<li>Add support for "r" torus primitives.</li>
<li>Added 64-bit version of the Windows Explorer thumbnail generator plugin, so
thumbnail generation can now be performed on 64-bit versions of Windows.</li>
<li>Added 64-bit Ubuntu package.</li>
</ul>
<b>Updates</b>
<ul>
<li>Updated Linux version to use Qt 4.4/4.5 instead of Qt 3.3.</li>
<li>Removed BFC and Show Axes from the default toolbar (Windows and Mac
only).</li>
<li>Updated examine/fly-through status bar icons.</li>
<li>Changed the Model Bounding Box feature to be a toggle.</li>
<li>Updated full screen mode to not change the display settings if the requested
display mode matches the current display mode.</li>
<li>Updated snapshot save to include MPD sub-model name as part of the default
filename if an MPD sub-model is selected.</li>
<li>Updated LGEO POV export to use LGEO studs even on non-LGEO parts.</li>
<li>Updated automatic part downloading to improve its performance.</li>
<li>Updates library update check to scan all existing part files to determine
the latest update already installed, instead of trying to figure this out based
on the contents of files in the models directory.</li>
<li>Updated handling of quads with colinear points to split the quad into two
triangles at the colinear point in order to avoid T-Junctions.</li>
<li>Improved detection of what version of the parts library is installed.</li>
</ul>
<b>Bug Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed problem that caused the view mode icon to show up in the wrong part
of the status bar sometimes, and show the lat/lon when in fly-through mode.</li>
<li>Fixed crash when loading a part with "Part Bounding Boxes Only"
 enabled.</li>
<li>Fixed resize grip on Model Tree dialog to not disappear immediately after
hiding the options.</li>
<li>Fixed bug that caused a crash any time you tried to bring up the screensaver
settings.</li>
<li>Fixed full screen support when used on a second monitor.</li>
<li>Fixed POV export to not apply seams to sub-parts of parts.</li>
<li>Fixed bug that caused the step in the toolbar to not update if you changed
steps while the model was rotating on its own.</li>
<li>Stop applying seams to parts that have been transformed non-uniformly.  This
was causing significant problems with flex tubes, which are stretched to
arbitrary lengths.  The excessive stretching messed up the seam calculation,
causing them to be way too short.</li>
<li>Fixed primitive substitution with 48-segment torus primitives to extract the
proper angle from the filename, instead of 3 times the proper angle.</li>
<li>Fixed steps on toolbar when number of steps is more than 100.</li>
<li>Fixed ring primitive substitution to support n-16rinx.dat files.</li>
<li>Fixed opaque dithered extended colors to not be transparent.</li>
<li>Fixed problem when a new preference set was selected via Apply (not OK) and
the new pref set has a different FSAA state than the previous one.</li>
<li>Fixed it to give an error if the latest update currently installed doesn't
show up on ldraw.org's ptreleases.cgi script.</li>
<li>Fixed Windows Explorer thumbnail generator plugin to not skip some LDraw
files.</li>
<li>Fixed uninstall to perform a reboot if uninstalling the Windows Explorer
thumbnail generator plugin, which often fails to properly uninstall without a
reboot.</li>
<li>Fixed final conditional line in cyls2 primitive substitution to not be
wrong when "Curve Quality" is set to anything other than its default value.</li>
<li>Fixed "Check for Library Updates" to properly deal with recent part
libaries.</li>

<td colspan="2">
<b>Additions</b><br/>
<ul>
<li>New Cocoa-based LDView for the Mac.</li>
<li>Added basic support for steps.</li>
<li>Added export feature to convert LDraw files into other file formats.
Currently POV-Ray and Stereo Lithography file formats are supported.</li>
<li>Added Model Tree dialog (drawer in Cocoa version) to show a tree with all
the data from the model.</li>
<li>Added MPD model selection to show sub-models inside MPD models.</li>
<li>Added new latitude/longitude rotation mode.</li>
<li>Added dialog to set the latitude/longitude.  (This does not require you to
be in the new latitude/longitude rotation mode.)</li>
<li>Added support for multiple processors, and multi-core processors.
Transparency sorting and conditional line calculations now happen in background
threads when LDView is run on a computer with more than one processor core.</li>
<li>Added option to show the coordinate axes for the model, originating at the
model's origin.</li>
<li>Added support for JPEG snapshots.  The default JPEG settings are set using
rarely-used JPEG compression options that result in much better quality for
computer-generated imagery than is typically achieved with image tools.
(Specifically, LDView uses the 4:4:4 JPEG color sub-sampling by default.)</li>
<li>Added Bounding Box dialog that shows the minimum and maximum coordinates of
the bounding box for the model, and draws that bounding box.</li>
<li>Added view mode that only shows part bounding boxes.</li>
<li>Added support for rotation in examine mode with the arrow keys on the
keyboard.</li>
<li>Added steps to m6459.ldr sample model.</li>
<li>Added -SaveSnapshots command line option to allow multiple snapshots to be
saved at once from the command line.</li>
<li>Added "Transparent background" and "Auto-crop" to the snapshot saving UI.
(Previously, these options were only available via manual registry entries or
command line parameters.)</li>
<li>Added ability to set the 3D portion of the LDView window to various sizes
with standard aspect ratios.</li>
<li>Added ability to use the current LDView aspect ratio in the POV-Ray camera
info command.</li>
<li>Added ability to control the default directory where snapshots and part
lists get saved.  Choices are in the model directory, the most recently used
directory for the given file type, or a specified directory.</li>
<li>Added support for Black_Edge color definition.  Add a color to your
ldconfig.ldr with Black_Edge as its color name (case doesn't matter), and
LDView will use the given color for its black edge lines (assuming that
"Process ldconfig.ldr is checked in the general prefs.)</li>
<li>Added icons from toolbar to corresponding menu items when running in Windows
Vista.</li>
</ul>
<b>Updates</b><br/>
<ul>
<li>Decreased the amount of time needed to make certain preference changes (for
example, toggling edge lines).</li>
<li>Greatly improved the output quality of "Transparent background" snapshots
when antialiased lines are enabled.</li>
<li>Changed snapshot rendering in Windows to do software rendering directly to
an in-memory bitmap when the Pixel Buffer OpenGL extension is unavailable or
disabled.  Previously, it rendered into the window, which caused a window to
appear for command line snapshot renders.</li>
<li>Changed the default setting for conditional lines from off to on.  Note that
since edge lines default to off, this won't be seen until the first time edge
lines are enabled.</li>
<li>Changed the default setting for seams to on.</li>
<li>Rotated 8464.mpd sample model 180 degrees so that it faces forward in the
default viewing angle.</li>
<li>Updated the toolbar to have smaller buttons in Windows XP and Windows
Vista.</li>
<li>Changed "Always black" edges to be truly black, instead of whatever color
was assigned to color code 0.</li>
<li>Updated "Always black" edges to use gray when used on dark colors, isntead
of black.</li>
</ul>
<b>Bug Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Windows version so that switching to full screen doesn't trigger a
full model reload.</li>
<li>Fixed handling of shift key when moving via the keyboard in fly-through
mode.</li>
<li>Fixed check boxes in group box titles in preferences to only show underlines
under mnemonic characters when appropriate when running with themes
enabled.</li>
<li>Fixed bug where mouse control got messed up badly if you used
&lt;Alt&gt;&lt;Tab&gt; to switch to another program while dragging with the
mouse in LDView.</li>
<li>Don't show model load failure error message if the user cancels the model
load.</li>
<li>Fixed bug that sometimes caused a vertical line to appear on the left edge
of large snapshots.</li>
<li>Fixed handling of transparent and invisible LDLite color codes.</li>
<li>Fixed Errors &amp; Warnings Dialog on Windows verison to show the proper
error and warning counts when the dialog isn't shown automatically.</li>
<li>Fixed lock up when "Show View Info" was selected in Windows while themodel
was spinning.</li>
<li>Diable Open Model toolbar button during load.  Using it would result in a
crash.</li>
<li>Fixed bug where hitting escape during load didn't work in Windows Vista
(and maybe other versions of Windows also).</li>
<li>Fixed bug where changing to a new LDraw directory would still give you a
message that the LDraw directory could not be found.</li>
<li>Fixed primitive substitution to work with primitives in the Unofficial/p
directory.</li>
<li>Fixed primitive substitution for 3-8ndis primitive.</li>
<li>Fixed fly-through speed to be dependent of FPS, so that having a super
high FPS doesn't produce super fast fly-through.</li>
<li>Fixed primitive substitution to work better with curve smoothing with
cone, sphere, and torus primitives.</li>
<li>Fixed problem with condtional lines showing up when they weren't supposed to
when their control points went outside of the view frustum.</li>

<b>Additions</b><br/>
<ul>
<li>Added ability to generate an HTML parts list of your model.</li>
<li>Added ability to set the direction that the light source points, both with
predefined light directions in the Preferences Dialog, and by holding down
Shift and dragging with the mouse.</li>
<li>Added support for light.dat files in LDraw models.  Unless disabled, these
will generate point light sources in the scene, up to a total of 8 lights.</li>
<li>Added ability to use LDView to generate thumbnails of .ldr and .mpd files in
Windows Explorer and Gnome Nautilus.</li>
<li>Made it so dragging with the middle mouse button pans (in addition to
the existing dragging with the left mouse button while holding down
Control).</li>
<li>Added support for anisotropic filtering on video cards that support it.</li>
<li>Added scroll wheel support to QT version.</li>
<li>Added BFC toolbar button to QT version.</li>
<li>Added support for the new !ldraw_org meta-statement to be used in the next
official parts release.</li>
</ul>
<b>Updates</b><br/>
<ul>
<li>Made it so that settings specified on the command line don't get saved as if
they had been specified in the UI.  (For example, -WindowWidth=320 on the
command line would result in LDView launching with a window width of 320 the
next time it was run.)</li>
<li>Updated Zoom to Fit command so that the model remaines auto-centered after
using it.</li>
<li>Moved Errors &amp; Warnings, Show View Info, and Show POV-Ray Camera Info to
a new Tools menu.</li>
<li>Made it so only the main row of an error entry is bold.  Sub-rows are now
non-bold.</li>
<li>Made it so that transparency values of 240 and above are considered opaque.
This was done to get rid of ugly artifacts that show up on the glow-in-the-dark
color, which has a transparency value of 250.</li>
</ul>
<b>Bug Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed bug in error reporting that would lead to a crash when the model file
has a really long line.</li>
<li>Fixed command line processing of -SaveSnapshot so that it doesn't generate a
blank snapshot.</li>
<li>Fixed bug that caused the LDView screensaver to crash when you tried to
bring up its settings.</li>
<li>Fixed bug where some models would be clipped after a Zoom to Fit.</li>
<li>Fixed bug where the Errors &amp; Warnings window would sporadically not draw
correctly after being resized.</li>
<li>Fixed cutaway wireframe causing one entire eye image to be drawn in
wireframe when stereo is enabled.</li>
<li>Fixed tiled snapshot saves to not ignore the SaveAlpha setting.</li>
<li>Fixed -cg option to support the optional radius portion.</li>
<li>Fixed tiled snapshot saves when PBuffer isn't available to make the image
size an even multiple of the number of tiles used.  It already did this with
PBuffer snapshots.  With non-PBuffer snapshots, you ended up with a border
(usually black) on the top and right sides of the image.</li>
<li>Fixed display glitch in Windows versions when switching the viewing angle
via the toolbar.  Switching the viewing angle via the main menu still has the
display glitch.</li>
<li>Fixed command line snapshot saves to pay attention to the file extension of
the snapshot file specified on the command line, instead of using the
SaveImageType setting.</li>
<li>Fixed crash when LDView encounters two LDraw files that refer to each other.
It now generates an error and skips the child model's reference to its
ancestor model.</li>

<b class="Bigger">3.0</b><br/>
(13 Dec, 2005)
</td>
<td colspan="2">
<b>Additions</b><br/>
<ul>
<li>Completely new rendering engine, written from scratch.  This allows for
the following enhancements that would have been very difficult before:
<ul>
<li>Significantly reduced memory usage on large models.  Measured reduction on
Orion Pobursky's Imperial Star Destroyer model with all settings set to default:
86%.  The same, but with LDView 3's <i>Memory usage</i> setting set to Low: 90%.
(Note that these are <i>reductions</i> of and 86% and 90%, respectively, meaning
LDView 3 requires 16% the memory LDView 2.1.01 requires on that model with
default settings.)</li>
<li>Significantly reduced load time on large models.</li>
<li>BFC (Back Face Culling) support.</li>
<li>BFC verification support (red back faces and/or green front faces).</li>
<li>Potentially faster rendering.  (Actual speed differences vary significantly
based on video hardware and what settings are set.)</li>
<!--<li>Support for steps (not implemented yet, but coming).</li>-->
</ul></li>
<li>Added a toolbar (which can of course be disabled if desired).</li>
<li>Added support for translation DLLs.</li>
<li>Added a distinction between errors and warnings.</li>
<li>Added detection of more problems and potential problems with model files,
leading to more errors and warnings.</li>
<li>Added support for making the default color transparent.  (Primarily useful
for part authors.)</li>
<li>Added direct access to the help file to the Linux version.</li>
<li>Added primitive substitution support for full-circle versions of new torus
primitives.</li>
<li>Added primitive substitution support for chord primitives.</li>
<li>Added context-sensitive help to the save snapshot dialog.</li>
<li>Added workaround for snapshot corruption that was happening on some video
cards (<i>Don't use Pixel Buffer</i> option during snapshot save).</li>
<li>Added Memory usage option to allow LDView to conserve even more memory.
(This comes at the possible expense of speed.  However, if you're swapping when
the <i>Memory usage</i> setting is set to High, and not swapping when it's set
to Low, then Low will be faster.)</li>
<li>Added support for LDraw search directory list in ldraw.ini using Lars
 Hassing's LDrawIni code.</li>
<li>Added support for spaces in submodel filenames.  (Generates a warning.)</li>
<li>Added extra command line parsing for use when using LDView as a renderer
from LPub.</li>
<li>Added detection of primitive comment so that primitive detection can work on
primitives outside the ldraw\p directory.</li>
<li>Added support for automatic cropping of images (via the command line only;
no UI at this time.</li>
<li>Added new sample model created by Peter Bartfai: 8464.mpd.</li>
</ul>
<b>Updates</b><br/>
<ul>
<li>Rearranged items in the File menu.</li>
<li>Revamped error dialog box.</li>
<li>Removed the recompile requirement for P-Buffer snapshots.</li>
<li>Updated primitive substitution support to also substitute primitives in the
p/48 directory.</li>

Canceling a load can now be accomplished either by hitting escape or selecting
the <i>Cancel Load</i> item on the file menu.  Even when the status bar is set

resolution was 1600x1200 or lower, you had to be in stereo mode in order to
witness this bug.</li>

preserving the model's scale (instead of shrinking the model down to
nothing).  This fix probably removes the need for the field of view cap fix

(27 Jan, 2002)
</td>
<td align="right">
<b>Additions</b>
</td>
<td><ul>
<li>Added support for panning the camera.</li>
<li>Added setting to always use black for edge lines.  This is most useful for
part authors to be able to see the edge lines better.</li>
<li>Added setting to control the curve quality of primitive substitution.  The
minimum value produces 8-sided circles; the maximum produces 48-sided
circles.</li>
<li>Added primitive substitution support for new torus primitives.</li>
<li>Added primitive substitution support for "ndis" (not-disk) primitives.
This is necessary for curve quality to work well.</li>
<li>Added progress panel during PNG file creation.  This is especially useful
for high-resolution files.  Hitting cancel cancels the save and deletes the
incomplete PNG file.</li>
</ul></td></tr>

<tr><td align="right">
<b>Updates</b>
</td>
<td><ul>
<li>Renamed m6459.dat to m6459.ldr like it was supposed to be named in
v1.9.</li>
<li>Updated default zoom level to slightly higher.  In all but the most extreme
circumstances, the model will still never go outside the window borders at this
zoom level.</li>
<li>Updated to disable seam width setting if seams are disabled.</li>
<li>Updated primitive substitution to parse primitive names in a more generic
fashion.</li>
</ul></td></tr>

<tr><td align="right">
<b>Bug fixes</b>
</td>
<td><ul>
<li>Fixed error window to update when the model is reloaded (either manually
or automatically via polling).</li>
<li>Fixed background color chooser dialog to be a child of the preferences
panel.</li>
<li>Fixed problem where canceling the preferences wouldn't fully reset the
background color, seam width, FSAA mode and stereo mode.</li>
<li>Fixed the preferences dialog to properly free up the resources it allocates
when opened.</li>
<li>Fixed seam width adjustment to work again.</li>
<li>Fixed it so that menus will work when the model is spinning and animated
menus are enabled in Windows.  The spinning now pauses when you go to select
from a menu.</li>
<li>Fixed drag/drop support so that dropped files update the most recent open
directory and show up on the recent files list.</li>
<li>Fixed image save with dimensions that are too large to display the
appropriate error message.</li>
<li>Fixed print progress panel to stop it from flickering, and changed text
from "Printing..." to "Printing Model.".</li>
<li>Fixed primitive substitution to get rid of false positives.</li>
<li>Fixed serious memory leaks introduced in version 1.9.</li>
</ul></td></tr>

<li>Added context-sensitive help for all preferences.</li>
<li>Added recent files list.</li>
<li>Added support for .ldr as a standard LDraw file extension.</li>
<li>Added error panel to display errors encountered when loading a model.
Added an option to automatically display this panel after loading a model if
errors are detected during the load.</li>
<li>Added progress panel with cancel button while model is loading,
compiling, or printing.</li>
<li>Added option to sort transparent polygons.  This produces a more correct
rendering, but can slow things down.  The sorting is not correct 100% of the
time yet.</li>
<li>Added menu item to the View menu to reset the view back to the orientation
that is displayed when a model is first loaded.</li>
<li>Added sample file (m6459.dat) to distribution.</li>
<li>Added ability to set maximum zoom level.  (Suggested and demoed by
Carsten Schmitz.)  Currently requires Registry editing.</li>
<li>Added version resource to executable.</li>
<li>Added WGL Extensions menu item to Help->OpenGL Info submenu.</li>
<li>Added release dates to this document.</li>
<li>Added releases prior to 0.5.1 to this document</li>

better allow for round-off.</li>

the sorting of transparent polygons.</li>
<li>Updated this document to be in table format.</li>
<li>Updated About Box to include "Thanks to" section.</li>
<li>Updated date format in About Box to "DD Mon, YYYY" format.</li>
<li>Updated high quality lines to only be available when Edge Lines are
enabled.</li>
<li>Updated so lighting settings are only available when lighting is
enabled.</li>
<li>Updated so wireframe fog is only available when wireframe is enabled.</li>
<li>Updated to statically link against my own libraries, so TCFoundation.dll and
CUI.dll are no longer necessary.</li>
<li>Removed code which prevents any axis from being scaled to 0.</li>
<li>Updated to decrease the size of the model when the window is made narrower
than its height.  This is particularly useful when Stereo is enabled, as the
two views are often taller than they are wide.</li>

originally that didn't exist in 95.)</li>
<li>Fixed primitive substitution bug where enabling seams was producing
incorrect surface normals.</li>
<li>Fixed part-determination for seams to allow part names which end with a
letter.  I incorrectly thought that these would all be sub-parts.  I now
determine whether it is a subpart based on whether its parent model is a
part.</li>
<li>Fixed it to get the ldraw dir out of the registry when you specify a file on
the command line.</li>
<li>Fixed seam code to shrink a part even when it is the main file which is
opened.  (This has extremely marginal value, but is more cosistent.)</li>

<li>Fixed it to search the MODELS subdirectory of the LDRAW directory when
looking for a part.</li>

mode gracefully after presenting the error panel (instead of waiting for you to
switch back manually, then crashing without restoring the video mode).</li>

0.9<br/>
(25 Sep, 2000)
</td>
<td align="right">
<b>Additions</b>
</td>
<td><ul>
<li>Added sphere primitive substitution.  This was--<b>by far</b>--the hardest
primitive substitution.  Unlike the other primitive substitutions, the sphere
primitive substitution results in a different set of polygons being drawn.  The
sphere that LDView creates is made up of 16 triangles, unlike the standard
sphere primitive, which is made up of 9 quads and 4 triangles.</li>
<li>Added support for black rubber (color 256).  I made it <b>significantly</b>
less shiny when specular lighting is enabled.  (There is no visual difference
when specular lighting is disabled.)</li>
<li>Added support for stipple transparency.</li>
</ul></td></tr>

<tr><td align="right">
<b>Updates</b>

much more in keeping with standard Win32 programming guidelines.</li>

<tr><td align="right">
<b>Bug fixes</b>
</td>
<td><ul>
<li>Fixed NT bug where the video mode list would have a bunch of repeats for
each resolution (one for each refresh rate at that resolution, I think).</li>
<li>Fixed bug where background color button would not show the currently
selected color if you used Ctrl+Shift+P to bring up the preferences panel for
the first time.</li>
<li>Fixed bug where concave polygons with non-winding points would cause a
crash.  I definitely fixed the crash; I think I fixed it so that they will
actually draw correctly as well.</li>
<li>Fixed possible bug in substituted primitive color setting.  I never saw the
problem exhibit itself, but the code seemed wrong.</li>
</ul></td></tr>

<tr><td class="NoWrap" rowspan="3" align="right">
0.7.5<br/>
(08-Sep, 2000)
</td>
<td align="right">
<b>Additions</b>
</td>
<td><ul>
<li>Added primitive substitution option.  This produces higher quality output,
as well as slightly enhanced performance.  I have created substitutions for the
following primitives:
<ul>
<li>Low-res Studs (Standard Studs are made up of other primitives.)</li>
<li>Cylinders</li>

<li>Disks (no visual difference)</li>

triangles).</li>

<tr><td align="right">
<b>Updates</b>
</td>
<td><ul>
<li>Optimized model-loading to decrease load time somewhat (only really
noticeable on really large models).</li>

it to work in fullscreen mode.</li>
</ul></td></tr>

<tr><td align="right">
<b>Bug fixes</b>

model so that if it references other sub-models it will still work.</li>

with subparts will work.</li>
<li>Fixed bug in which color wasn't initialized properly always, resulting in
incorrect colors sometimes.</li>
<li>Fixed keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+O, Ctrl+Q, Ctrl+Shift+P, etc).  Although I
believe they worked when I originally added them, they have been broken for
awhile now.  Note that these work while in fullscreen mode on some video cards,
so you can now change options and open a new file without having to switch back
to windowed mode (assuming you remember Ctrl+O and Ctrl+Shift+P).</li>
