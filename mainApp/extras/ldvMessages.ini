; This file contains most of the strings that LDView shows to the user that
; aren't hard-coded into the interface.  (The rest are in
; LDExporter\LDExportMessages.ini.)  Please obey the following rules for both
; of these files:
; * Do NOT modify anything on the left sides of the equal signs.
; * Do NOT put a space after the equal sign before the translated text.
; * Do NOT add or remove any format elements (% followed by other characters).
;   If you do, you will cause LDView to behave in an unusual way, or possibly
;   even crash.
; * Do NOT remove any of the formatting entries (\n, \r, etc.).
; * If your translated text requires more lines in this file than the English
;   version, use the PrefSetAbandonConfirm text below as an example.  When
;   wrapping to multiple lines, put a number after the tag, starting with 0, and
;   increasing as high as needed.  Don't forget to include a space at the end of
;   wrapped lines, as one will NOT be added automatically.
; * If your text is shorter than the English version, simply delete the extra
;   lines in the file.  If this drops the number of lines down to 1, delete the
;   0 after the tag.
; * If your translated text requires a backslash (\) that wasn't already there
;   (and I can't imagine why it would), please note that you must enter a double
;   backslash instead (see PrefSetNameBadChars0).
; * This file is UTF-8 (with Byte Order Mark). Make sure your text editor
;   supports that.
;
; Console output:
; Some strings are marked as console output.  This means that they will be
; output to the console.  They only show up if LDView is run from the command
; line.  They must be formatted to fit nicely on an 80 column text display.
; So I would advise translating them in one big line, then splitting them up
; into lines no longer than 80 columns each, then appending a \n to each line,
; then splitting the final result up here in this file.  If the English string
; has a \n at the very end of it, make sure to include that in the translated
; string.
; Also note: the console isn't Unicode.  It uses a code page.  Unicode text
; should be converted to the default code page before output, but this has not
; been tested.

PovFindReplacementsTT1 =If you check this, you can put POV include files in a pov subdirectory of your LDraw directory and
PovFindReplacementsTT2 =have LDView use those as replacements for part files.  In order for this to work, you must put your part files
PovFindReplacementsTT3 =in the <LDraw directory>/pov/parts directory, and put your primitive files in the <LDraw directory>/pov/p
PovFindReplacementsTT4 =directory.  Give them the same filename as the LDraw file, but replace the .dat extension with .inc.
PovXmlMap =Use XML mapping file
PovXmlMapTT1 =Check this to have LDView use the specified XML mapping file to find POV replacements for LDraw parts.  LDView's
PovXmlMapTT2 =default mapping file will work with LGEO parts.  In order to render the POV file produced, you must have the associated
PovXmlMapTT3 =POV parts library installed.
PovXmlMapPath =Path to XML mapping file:
PovXmlMapPathTT =If you leave this blank, and check "Use XML mapping file", LDView will use LGEO.xml in the LDView install directory.
PovInlinePov =Use inline POV statements in LDraw parts

PovInlinePovTT2 =replaced with native POV geometry.  Check this if you want to use that native POV geometry.
